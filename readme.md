# Ober's Better Traders

This data pack aims to make wandering traders more useful in general. Below will detail what has been changed

# God tools

Finding diamonds and setting up all the villagers for all the required enchantments is definitely possible but tedious. It would be nice if the wandering trader always has something that you'd love to buy. For that reason **every wandering traders first trade will be a god enchanted item** whether it's a tool or armor you'll guaranteed want it. But it comes at a price! (64 emeralds)
